# Animated Canvas
This repository holds the source code for the Mass Spring System used for Group Three's project 'Animated Canvas'.

The code requires OpenGL, as well as GLUT (the code herein uses FreeGLUT).

There is a CMakeLists.txt file which can be used to generate the project for Windows, OSX, or Linux -- simply install CMake
and run `cmake .` to generate the project files and executable.
